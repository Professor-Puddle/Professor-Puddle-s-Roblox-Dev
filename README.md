# Professor Puddle's Roblox Dev
Hello! Welcome to Professor Puddle's Roblox Dev!<br>
This is a Roblox exploit script hub. This was mainly made for [Roblox Murder Mystery 2](https://google.com), but I realized it had potential, so I decided to add more scripts into it, and well now I have a hub that you can use. This has a lot of useful features for Murder Mystery 2, but most of the features can be run in other games as well. If you want more scripts to be added, Join my discord server, and DM me.<br><br>
If you don't know how to use my script, [watch this tutorial video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDjqGiKGxY)
